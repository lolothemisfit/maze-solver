# maze-solver

This project is game I created that solves a maze.
You solve the maze with an object called a robot that you can name.
The robot can perform different moves to solve the maze (Forward, Back, Left, Right, Repeat, Repeat Silent, Repeat Reverse, Sprint).
- FORWARD: moves the robot forward by n steps.
- BACK: moves the robot back by n steps.
- LEFT: turns the robot left.
- RIGHT: turns the robot right.
- REPEAT: repeats the moves the robot previous did.
- REPEAT SILENT: repeats the moves the robot previously did in silence.
- REPEAT REVERSE: repeats the moves the robot previously did in reverse order.
- SPRINT: the robot sprints by n moves.


The robot has the option to solve the maze manual or automatically with the use of an algorythym I created to solve the maze.
To solve the maze automatically you use the move "mazerun" which also has the otion to solve the maze either Left, Right, Top, Bottom (these are directions
are the different exits for the maze.)

The program can run on the terminal and has a visual illustration which I used the Turtle module to create.
